## Issues
### Issue Title
The issue title represents the issue, so please choose a name that fits. You cannot assign any tags 
by yourself, but adding a word like 'Add' or 'Fix' as the first word really help to oversee the issues.
Also, it's important to keep the name short enough to be readable as a whole without breaking the line.
Not needed, but nice to have: Captitalize the first word. It looks better.
### Issue Body
Here you can be more specific as you were in the title, so please explain what has happened or what
you want to add. Please write whole, grammaticaly correct, sentences and if you can, format your texts with 
markdown. Also remember: One picture says more than a thousand words. In issues pics, gifs or videos can really help
and are better then 'this thing there is broken. go fix it'. It also helps if you have a bit knowledge about what you're talking when you specify the problem. For example the taskbar on you PC is not called "The thing down there where you can start your apps". 
### Comments
This is the place to disguss. Don't get angry if someone don't share your opinion, rather try to convince him while staying friendly. This is the most important thing: If your unfriendly no matter your skill level, no one will respect you. Always remember that you're the one who wants something.
